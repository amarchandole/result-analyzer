<b>UoP Result Analysis</b>

This project aims to facilitate easy data storage and analysis of a college's result.  It uses regular expressions to map different types of fields intelligently and parses through the complete document with thousands of entries to automatically populate the database. There will be an underlying database system that will store a student's entire academic history in the college. Data can be sorted and filtered using various criteria like a specefic subject or a set of subjects. There will be a manual mode that facilitates easy manual entry of a student's result in cases of rare exceptions.  


The application is made using Java, and uses MongoDB for the underlying database.
